                    <p>UnboxxEd is a hypothetical e-business that was created as an online marketing and business management exercise. As an in-house web development team, our goal was to increase sales and web traffic for a company that was not relevant on the internet. One of our main tasks included developing a website and mobile application visitors could access on any device. Developing an online marketing campaign was necessary to attract visitors from outside sources. We would also deploy a team of analytics and data specialists who would be responsible for evaluating keywords and managing an SEO program. This information would be gathered by monitoring user's habits and actions.

                       During the summer of 2019, Nick's management team contacted me regaurding Nick's website. At the time The team did not have a member dedicated to the creation of Nick's online presence. Throughout the remainder of the summer, I assisted in the development of a WordPress site along with corresponding banner graphics, interactive widgets, and a Mailchimp email campaign. For the purpose of this portfolio site, I have taken screenshots of the site after my duties were completed. However, feel free to check out the current site at <a href="http://nickelliott.com/">NickElliott.com</a>.

                    <p>James Madison University is located in the heart of the beautiful mountain city of Harrisonburg, VA. Due to Harrisonburg's diverse population of locals, students, and tourists, the city is able to boast about its modern, yet historic personality. One of the more significant aspects that the city enjoys promoting is eco-friendly behaviors such as recycling. With this in mind, RecycleMe!, has been developed as a mobile application in an attempt to aid residents of Harrisonburg and the surrounding areas with their recycling needs. RecycleMe! performs several tasks such as locating nearby recycling facilities, promoting creative recycling methods via weekly blogs, and encouraging community interaction through an enviro-friendly social media platform.

                    <p>To wrap up my second semester as a SMAD student, one of my assignments was directed towards showing off the HTML5 and CSS3 skills that had been obtained in one particular class; Hooked is a knock-off retail site that was developed for this reason. Guidelines of this assignment stated that we were responsible for creating a responsive retail website that would display four pages of content along with a makeshift privacy policy page, and scale to fit the dimensions of three different screen sizes. For my specific submission, I chose to do a mockup of a fishing tackle website by creating a home page that showcased featured sale items, a page specific to models of lures, a page dedicated to rods &amp; reels, and a page where users could view all items on sale.  All images have been borrowed from :
                        <a href="https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/">tacklewarehouse.com</a> and <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a>.

                    <p>Corporate websites often struggle with the challenge of presenting visual messages to a wide variety of target audiences. These target audiences have a wide variety of preferences. The latest approach to meeting this challenge is to build separate "micro" web sites that serve as companions to the main corporate site, but specifically targeted to each demographic. For this project, I created wireframes and mock-up user interface designs of a micro site targeted to college students, and a report to accompany my designs. I based my mock-up on a well known existing web site that does not currently have micro sites.

                    <p>For this assignment, each individual in the class was required to blog at least once a week regarding an article or media presentation related to that week's topic or topics. We applyied key concepts, terms or ideas learned in class to something found in a newspaper, magazine, book chapter, film, television/radio broadcast, podcast, or other online source. The blog is our space to explore, engage and connect the article or media presentation with the readings and materials shown in class. The requirements were to have each blog posting substantial enough for the reader to understand what the article/presentation is about, but was to be more than simply a summary of its content.
